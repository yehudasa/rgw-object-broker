# Ceph RGW Object Broker

## Utilize Kubernetes Service-Catalog to dynamically provision RGW Object Storage.

## Overview

The Ceph RGW object broker is heavily based on the [CNS Object Broker](https://github.com/yard-turkey/cns-object-broker). This includes
this documentation.

A core feature of the Kubernetes system is the ability to provision block and file storage on demand.
This project provides the ability to use the [Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and the RGW Object Broker
to provision Ceph RGW backed S3 buckets on demand.
A Ceph RGW installation can the S3 interface and backing storage. Service-Catalog enables communication between a client Kubernetes cluster and service provider.
The RGW Object Broker is the endpoint to which the Service-Catalog sends requests for services.

The RGW Object Broker handles requests to create and destroy RGW users and buckets and returns information and credentials that are required to use them.


### Topology
A Ceph cluster that has a configured RGW service is required. The RGW endpoint will need to be accessible by the RGW object broker. The Ceph cluster
can be installed anywhere, not necesarily on Kubernetes.
The RGW object broker needs to be installed on a Kubernetes cluster. The Service-Catalog can be installed on a separate
Kubernetes cluster.

### Nomenclature

Before going further, it's useful to define common terms used throughout the entire system.
The relationships between the different systems and objects can be seen in the [control flow diagram](docs/diagram/control-diag.md).
There are a number of naming collisions which can lead to some confusion.

#### External Service Provider

- *External Service Provider*

  For our purposes, an External Service Provider is any system that offers services on demand via the [Open Service Broker](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker). The actual location of the External Service Provider is arbitrary.
  It can be a remote service provider like AWS S3, an on premise cluster, or colocated with the Service-Catalog.

  The External Service Provider should consist of two components: the service broker and the actual services being consumed by clients.  In this example, the service component is a RGW Object Storage cluster with a S3 REST API.

- *Broker*

  The broker presents a REST API which implements the [Open Service Broker](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker) for http routes.
  It functions as the endpoint to which the Service-Catalog communicates all requests for service operations.

##### RGW Broker Objects

- *ServiceInstance*

  A Broker's internal representation of a provisioned service.

- *Binding*

  A Broker's data structure for tracking coordinates and auth credentials for a single *ServiceInstance*. Each binding has a set of credentials
  allowing access of data by the service instance user.

- *Catalog*

  A complete list of services and plans that are provisionable by the Broker.

##### Service-Catalog API Objects

Here is where naming collisions become confusing.
All of the terms in this section are objects of the Service Catalog API Server.
The terms here are only Kubernetes' representation of the actual services provisioned in the External Service Provider.
They are managed by the `SC-APISERVER` portion of the [control flow diagram](docs/diagram/control-diag.md).

**NOTE: There is no Catalog object in the Service Catalog.  It is represented as a set of ServiceClasses only!**

- *ServiceBroker*

  Service Catalog representation of the actual Broker, usually located elsewhere.
  The Service Catalog Controller Manager will use the URL provided within the *ServiceBroker* to connect to the actual Broker server.
  A *ServiceBroker* can offer many *ServiceClasses*.

- *ServiceClass*

  Service Catalog representation of a *Catalog* offering.  When a *ServiceBroker* is created, the Service Catalog Controller Manager requests the *Catalog* from the actual Broker.
  The response is a json object listing all Services and Plans offered by the Broker.
  The Controller Manager processes this response into a set of *ServiceClasses* in the API Server.
  In this case, our *ServiceClass* is a provisionable RGW S3 bucket.
  A *ServiceClass* can provision many *ServiceInstances* of its class.

- *ServiceInstance*

  Service Catalog representation of a consumable service instance in the External Service Provider.
  In this case, a single bucket.
  A *ServiceInstance* can have many *Bindings*, so long as the service supports this.
  This enables a single instance to be consumed by many Pods.

- *Binding*

  Service Catalog object that does not contain any authentication or coordinate information.
  Instead, when a *Binding* is created in the Service Catalog API Server, it triggers a request to the Broker for authentication and coordinate information.
  Once a response is received, the sensitive information is stored in a *Secret* in the same namespace as the *Binding*.

### What the RGW Object Broker Does
This broker implements [Open Service Broker](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md) methods for creating, connecting to, and destroying
S3 buckets.
- For each new *ServiceInstance*, a new, uniquely named user is created, for which a new bucket is created.
- For each new *Binding*, a new S3 access-key and secret is are generated for the user that is associated with the service instance. The
bucket name, the RGW endpoint and the credentials are provided.
- Deleting a *Binding* removes the access-key/secret pair.
- Deleting a *ServiceInstance* suspends the generated user and bucket, and relinks the bucket to a different garbage collection user, where it can later be destroyed.

## Installation

The following steps are based on the original setup instructions that were using two separate clusters,
where one was running in Google cloud services, and the other one was using a local Kubernetes cluster.
The actual setup that was used for the development of the RGW service broker only consisted of a single
Kubernetes cluster. The following is an attempt to provide the steps that needed to be done for configuring
on multiple Kubernetes clusters, but expect some inaccuracies because of that. Other differences may exist,
like different namespaces or different contexts that were used. There may be more than one way to do
things.

### Dependencies
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes): to run local K8s cluster
- Kubernetes-Incubator [Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog): to provide Service-Catalog helm chart
- Kubernetes [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm#install): to install Service-Catalog chart

### Assumptions
- Ceph cluster with RGW service is deployed

The instructions assume there are two separate Kubernetes clusters. The service catalog will be installed
on one of them (_k1_), and the service broker will be installed on the other (_k2_). It is possible and trivial to install
both the service catalog and the _RGW service broker_ on the same Kuberentes cluster. The instructions will
refer to the different clusters for the sake of clarity. It is assumed that both clusters are controlled from
within the same environment, and there is only a single clone of the rgw-object-broker tree. Access
to different Kubernetes clusters can be done by leveraging config contexts.

## Setup

**NOTE: The following steps are performed from the local machine or VM unless stated otherwise.**

### Step 1: Preparing environment
- Clone [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes)
- Clone [Service-Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)


### Step 2: Deploy Kubernetes

For example the [Rook](https://rook.io/docs/rook/master/development-environment.html) instructions has instructions to install Kuberentes.

### Step 3: Deploy the Service-Catalog

The service catalog wil be deployed on Kubernetes cluster _k1_.

1. Change directories to the `./kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/` repository.

2. Follow the [Service-Catalog Installation instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/docs/install.md)

## Installing the Service Broker and Creating the **ServiceBroker** API Object
**STOP!** If you have made it this far, it is assumed that you now have

- A Ceph cluster with RGW service configured
- A Kubernetes cluster with service catalog installed on
- Optional: a second Kubernetes cluster installed, where the service broker will be running

3. Create RGW user that will be used as the admin user

`[k2] $ radosgw-admin user create --uid=kube-broker --caps="metadata=read,write;users=read,write;buckets=read,write"`

Note the generated access key and secret key pairs that were generated for that user

4. Install the RGW service broker

Update charts/values.yaml.template with the RGW endpoint, the RGW ZoneGroup, and the admin user's credentials (and any other settings if needed).

    $ make broker

Push the built image to _k2_. Then use `helm` to install the service catalog char on the _k2_ cluster:

    [k2] $ make push
    [k2] $ helm install chart --name broker --namespace broker

Then retrieve the broker's external address and generate the scripts/yaml/broker.yaml (using the helper script under
`scripts/get-broker-addr.sh`):

    [k2] $ scripts/get-broker-addr.sh

Now use `helm` to install the service catalog chart on the _k1_ cluster:

    [k1] $ helm install chart --name broker --namespace broker

Then from the newly created service named `broker-rgw-object-broker-node-port` it reads the external port
number that will be used for the RGW service broker, and updates `broker.yaml`. Now it can be installed:

    [k1] $ kubectl create -f scripts/yaml/broker.yaml

---

## Using the Service Catalog

**STOP!** If you have made it this far, it is assumed that you now have
nstall
- A Kubernetes cluster with the service catalog installed on
- A Ceph cluster with RGW service configured
- The RGW Object Broker running on a Kubernetes cluster (potentially separate cluster)

You can check the status of all the Kubernetes related components

    [k2] $ kubectl get pod,svc --all-namespaces


Optionally the `svcat` tool is very useful to monitor the service catalog status. Refer to the service
catalog installation instructions for how to install it.


## Verify the *ServiceBroker*

If successful, the Service-Catalog controller manager will have generated a *ServiceClass* for the `rgw-bucket-service`.


    [k1] # kubectl --context=service-catalog get clusterservicebroker,clusterserviceclasses

    NAME                               AGE
    servicebrokers/rgw-bucket-broker   28s

    NAME                                AGE
    serviceclasses/rgw-bucket-service   28s

If you do not see a *ServiceClass* object, see [Debugging](#debugging).

### Create the *ServiceInstance* (API Object)


The `scripts/` directory contains a few scripts that can be used with the _k1_ cluster to create and remove
a service instance, and to create and remove bindings. The following steps are provide the same functionality.

1. *ServiceInstances* are namespaced.  Before proceeding, the *Namespace* must be created.

    [k1] $ kubectl create namespace test-ns

**NOTE: To set your own *Namespace*, edit examples/service-catalog/service-instance.yaml**

Snippet:
```yaml
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  namespace: test-ns  #Edit to set your own or use as is.
```

2. Now create the *ServiceInstance*.

*Optional:* Set a custom bucket name.  If one is not provided, a random bucket name is generated.

```yaml
    spec:
      parameters:
        bucketName: "rgw-bucket-demo" #Optional
```

Create the ServiceInstance:

    [k1] $ kubectl create -f examples/service-catalog/service-instance.yaml

3. Verify the *ServiceInstance*.

    [k1] $ kubectl --context=service-catalog -n test-ns get serviceinstances rgw-bucket-instance -o yaml

Look for the these values in the ouput:

Snippet:
```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    reason: ProvisionedSuccessfully
    message: The instance was provisioned successfully
```

If the *ServiceInstance* fails to create, see [Debugging](#debugging).

### Create the *Binding* (API Object)

1. Create the *Binding*.

    [k1] $ kubectl create -f examples/service-catalog/service-instance-credential.yaml

2. Verify the *Binding*.

    [k1] $ kubectl -n test-ns get servicebindings

*Binding* will result in a *Secret* being created in same Namespace.
Check for the secret:

    [k1] $ kubectl -n test-ns get secret rgw-bucket-credentials

```
NAME                     TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
rgw-bucket-credentials   Opaque                                5         2m
```

If you want to verify the data was transmitted correctly, get the secret's yaml spec.

    [k1] $ kubectl -n test-ns get secret rgw-bucket-credentials -o yaml

Snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  accessKey: VVBLRTdNMlFWNjVBVU01UlFNRDE=
  bucketEndpoint: aHR0cDovLzEwLjE3LjExMi4yOjgwMDA=
  bucketName: YmM3bG1lMWx1dHFnMDBmZ2dmcWc=
  secretKey: cEE0Z1VZSDJIeVlmN3J0OWZtUGJmeDNYNVJUQU9BQXNNOGxxM1ozdQ==
  userName: bXlrdWJlLWJjN2xtZTFsdXRxZzAwZmdnZnIw
```

Decode the data:

    # echo "<value>"" | base64 -d

---

## Debugging

#### Broker Log

To determine if the broker has encountered an error that may be impacting *ServiceInstance* creation,
it can be useful to examine the broker's log.

1. Get the unique name of the Broker *Pod*.

    [k2] $ kubectl get pods -n broker

2. Using the Broker *Pod's* name, use `kubectl` to output the logs.

    [k2] $ kubectl -n broker logs -f <broker pod name>

####  Inspecting Service-Catalog API Objects

Service-Catalog objects can return yaml or json formatted data just like core Kubernetes api objects.
To output the data, the command is:

    # kubectl --context=service-catalog get -o yaml <service-catalog object>

Where `<service-catalog object>` is:
- `clusterservicebroker`
- `clusterserviceclass`
- `serviceinstance`
- `binding`

Also it might be that some of the objects were created under a specific namespace, so adding
`--namespace <namespace>` might be required.

#### Redeploy Service Catalog

Sometimes it's just quicker to tear it down and start again.  Thanks to Helm, this is relatively painless to do.

1. Tear down Service-Catalog

    # helm delete --purge catalog

2. Deploy Service-Catalog

    # helm install charts/catalog --name catalog --namespace catalog

Once Service-Catalog has returned to a Running/Ready status, you can begin again by [creating a ServiceBroker object](#create-the-servicebroker-api-object).
